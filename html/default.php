Welcome to the Microbial Community Analysis (MiCA) web site.<br><br>

This web site and the tools you find here were developed by students
and faculty of the Initiative for Bioinformatics and Evolutionary
Studies (IBEST) at the University of Idaho who are members of the
Departments of Computer Science and Biological Sciences. The research
was funded by the P&amp;G Company.<br><br>

You can access an introduction to the tools available and instructions
for their use by clicking the Help icon on the Home Page menu.<br><br>

We hope you will find MiCA useful. Please <a class="email"
href="mailto:foster@uidaho.edu">email us</a> any comments, suggestions 
or questions.
