  format. The CSV file format is often used to exchange data between disparate 
  applications. The file format, as it is used in Microsoft Excel, has become 
  a widely accepted standard in the industry. A CSV file is a specially formatted 
  plain text file, which stores spreadsheet or basic database-style information 
  in a very simple format, with one record on each line, and each field within 
  that record separated by a comma. CSV files are often used as a simple way to 
  transfer a large volume of spreadsheet or database information between programs, 
  without concerning about special file types. The following figure show how to
